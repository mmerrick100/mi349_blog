                <h2>Fantasy Football Week 4 Results</h2>
                <p><img src="week4.jpg" alt= "my team's results for week 4" width="500" height="250"></p>
                <p>My week 4 matchup was against my good friend Nick. At the beginning of the week I was favored to win 160-145. Also, heading into the week I was the 4th rated team in the league and he was rated 2. Obviously a win would help me jump the standings and bring me closer to winning the grand prize.</p>

                <p>This week my team outplayed their projections and scored 189 points. The only players that did not match their projected points were Nick Chubb, Calvin Ridley, and Daniel Carlson. My MVP this week was Tyreek Hill, he was projected to score 19 points and ended up scoring 48! Other notable performances were given by Josh Allen, Dawson Knox, and Derrick Henry. My opponent ended up scoring 163 points, so it was a pretty decisive week 4 victory.</p>

        `       <p>Looking ahead to week 5, my team goes into a matchup against my friend Matt being 3-1. Matt's team goes into the week with a 2-2 record. It should be a fairly easy week for me, stay tuned for next week's results.</p>

                <h2>Fantasy Football Week 5 Results</h2>
                <p><img src="week5.jpg" alt= "my team's results for week 5" width="500" height="250"></p>
                <p>My week 5 matchup was against my friend Matt. I was 3-1 and in 3rd place heading into this week. Once again, I was favored to win the matchup. My team was projected to score 153 while his team was projected to score 147. Before the games started, I must admit I was a little nervous about how the week would go because of how strong Matt's team is. A win against Matt would prove I have one of the better teams in the league, and would make me the favorite to win the entire league.</p>

                <p>My team once again outplayed their projection and scored a whopping 194. My MVP this week was Josh Allen becuase he outplayed his projected point total by a very large total. Other notable performances were put on by Derrick Henry, Nick Chubb, Dawson Knox, and Emmanuel Sanders. Matt's team ended up being very tough competition, but I was able to sneak away with the 194-184 victory.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead towards week 6, my team is 4-1 and is in second place in the standings. I match up against a sub .500 team (Joe S's team). I am fairly confident that my team will win this game. Stay tuned for next week's results.</p>
